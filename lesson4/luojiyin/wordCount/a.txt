 canner provides a convenient interface for reading data such as a file of
 ewline-delimited lines of text. Successive calls to the Scan method will step
 hrough the 'tokens' of a file  skipping the bytes between the tokens. The
 pecification of a token is defined by a split function of type SplitFunc;
 he default split function breaks the input into lines with line
 ermination stripped. Split functions are defined in this package for
 canning a file into lines  bytes, UTF-8-encoded runes, and space-delimited
 ords. The client may instead provide a custom split function.
